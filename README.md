# 🪙 TrashCoin – Incentive-Based Smart Waste Management System

TrashCoin is a **reward-driven smart waste management platform** designed to promote responsible waste disposal by incentivizing users with virtual eco-credits called **TrashCoins**. The system bridges the gap between citizens and waste management services while encouraging sustainable behavior through a transparent reward mechanism.
